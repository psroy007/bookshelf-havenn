    <div class="container">
        <p>Narrator: In a world of secrets and shadows, one woman's curiosity would lead her down a dangerous path, one that would ultimately lead to her demise. This is the story of Sara, and the mystery of the USB drive.</p>

        <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Sara's apartment, daytime<br>
        Sara receives a small package in the mail and opens it. She finds a USB drive inside.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "What is this? Where did it come from?"<br>
        Sara plugs the USB drive into her laptop and begins to browse through the files.<br>
        Sara's face grows pale as she realizes the content of the files.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "This is... disturbing. What does it all mean?"<br>
        She removes the USB drive from her laptop and hides it in a drawer.</p>

        <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Sara's apartment, nighttime<br>
        Sara is awake, unable to sleep. She hears a strange noise outside her window.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "Is someone there?"<br>
        Sara gets up and looks out her window. She sees nothing, but the feeling of being watched persists.<br>
        The next day, Sara is still uneasy. She goes to work, but feels as though she is being followed.<br>
        At home that night, Sara decides to take another look at the USB drive.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "I know there's something more to this. I need to figure it out."<br>
        She begins to scroll through the files again, becoming more and more disturbed by what she sees.<br>
        Suddenly, Sara hears a knock at the door. She jumps, her heart racing.<br>
        She cautiously approaches the door and looks through the peephole. Outside, a tall, mysterious figure stands waiting.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "Who's there?"<br>
        There is no response.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "I'm not opening the door unless you tell me who you are!"<br>
        The figure remains silent.<br>
        Sara's fear turns to anger.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "Go away! Leave me alone!"<br>
        The figure turns and walks away from the door. Sara breathes a sigh of relief.</p>

        <p>But the reprieve is short-lived. The next day, Sara arrives home to find her apartment ransacked. Her belongings are strewn across the floor, and the USB drive is missing.<br>
        Sara is furious.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "Who did this? What do they want with me?"<br>
        She begins to search through the mess, desperate to find some clue that will lead her to the truth.<br>
        Hours pass, but Sara finds nothing. Defeated, she collapses onto the couch.<br>
        Just then, her phone rings. She answers it, expecting to hear from a friend or family member.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "Hello?"<br>
        On the other end of the line, a gravelly voice responds.<br>
        Voice: "Sara, we know what you're looking for. And we know where to find it."<br>
        Sara's heart pounds in her chest.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "Who is this? What do you want?"<br>
        The voice chuckles.<br>
        Voice: "We want what you have, Sara. And we will stop at nothing to get it."<br>
        Sara's fear turns to anger.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "You can't have it. It's not yours!"<br>
        The voice sighs, as if disappointed.<br>
        Voice: "Then I guess we'll just have to take it from you. By any means necessary."<br>
        The line goes dead.<br>
        Sara stares at the phone, her mind racing.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "What have I gotten myself into?"<br>
        Sara knows she's in danger. She packs a bag and leaves her apartment, determined to disappear before they find her.</p>

        <p>But she's too late.<br>
        As she rounds a corner, she's confronted by the tall figure she saw outside her door. Before she can react, they grab her and drag her into a van.<br>
        Sara struggles, but she's overpowered.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "Let me go! What do you want with me?"<br>
        The figure remains silent, their grip tight as they drive away.<br>
        Sara is taken to a remote location, where she's held captive in a small room.<br>
        Days pass, and she grows weaker and more desperate.<br>
        One night, she's awakened by the sound of footsteps outside her door. The door opens, and the figure from before enters the room.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "What do you want with me? Why are you doing this?"<br>
        The figure finally speaks, their voice low and cold.<br>
        Voice: "You know too much, Sara. And now, you must pay the price."<br>
        Sara's heart sinks as the figure pulls out a syringe.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "No, please. Don't do this. I won't tell anyone, I swear."<br>
        The figure shakes their head, their expression unyielding.<br>
        Voice: "It's too late for that. You should never have gotten involved."<br>
        Sara thrashes against her restraints as the figure approaches with the syringe.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "Please, please, please! I'm begging you, don't do this!"<br>
        The figure ignores Sara's pleas and injects the syringe into her arm.<br>
        Sara screams in terror as the liquid flows into her veins.<br>
        <strong>Sara:</strong> "No! No! No!"</p>

        <p>But it's too late.<br>
        The figure watches dispassionately as Sara's struggles slow and her eyes close. Her body goes limp.<br>
        Sara is dead.<br>
        The figure stands for a moment, staring down at Sara's body. Then, they turn and walk away, leaving the room in silence and darkness.<br>
        The days pass, and Sara's disappearance becomes a cold case. Her family and friends grieve, but they eventually move on with their lives.<br>
        Meanwhile, the shadowy figure and their associates continue to operate in the shadows, their secrets safe and their power unchallenged.<br>
        And so the truth behind Sara's death remains hidden, buried along with her body in a shallow grave in the woods.</p>

        <p>But perhaps, someday, someone will discover the truth. Perhaps, one day, the USB drive will resurface, and the shadowy figures will finally be brought to justice.</p>
