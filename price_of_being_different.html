            Scene: A typical day in the village of Trigulam. Mani, a young child, is playing in the dusty streets with his friends. Suddenly, he is called home by his mother, Amma.<br><br>

Amma: "Mani, come inside now! You know what the neighbors will say if they see you playing with those boys."<br><br>

Mani: "But Amma, why can't I play with my friends? They're my only ones!"<br><br>

Amma: "Because you're not like them, Mani. You're different. We're different. People like us... they don't understand us. They'll only hurt us if we don't hide our true selves."<br><br>

Mani, confusion and sadness in his eyes, reluctantly obeys his mother and goes inside.<br><br>

Scene: Years pass, and Mani is now a teenager. He tries his best to blend in, but he still struggles with feelings of isolation and despair. One day, he is approached by a group of boys.<br><br>

Boy 1: "Hey, Mani."<br><br>

Boy 1 (cont'd): "...We've seen you around, and we've been talking. We think it's time for you to pick a side. You can't be neither a boy or a girl forever, you know?"<br><br>

Mani, nervous and unsure: "I... I don't understand."<br><br>

Boy 2: "Well, you're either a man or a woman, right? So which is it?"<br><br>

Mani: "I... I'm neither. I'm just me."<br><br>

The boys exchange smirks.<br><br>

Boy 1: "Ha! See, we knew it. You're just a freak."<br><br>

Boy 2: "Yeah, a useless freak who doesn't belong anywhere."<br><br>

The boys begin to crowd around Mani, jeering and taunting him. Mani tries to push past them, but they won't let him go.<br><br>

Mani, desperation in his voice: "Please, just leave me alone. I've done nothing to you!"<br><br>

The boys laugh, one shoving Mani to the ground.<br><br>

Boy 3: "Oh, we're just getting started."<br><br>

Scene: Mani fought with them badly, and their parents complained about this incident to Mani's father.<br><br>

Mani's Father: "Shame on you!"<br><br>

Mani: "But Dad, it was..."<br><br>

Mani's Father: "Don't you dare to call me Dad. You are just a disappointment, an unworthy unwanted child."<br><br>

Scene: Mani runs away from home, bruised and shaken.<br><br>

Mani, sobbing: "I don't belong here. Everyone hates me. I'll never fit in. I wish I could just disappear."<br><br>

He went towards the riverbank. As Mani walked along the riverbank, the weight of his loneliness became too much to bear. Overcome with grief, he slowly waded into the water.<br><br>

As the cool water enveloped him, Mani felt a sense of relief, like the world's burdens were finally being lifted from his shoulders. He closed his eyes and let the river take him, surrendering to its embrace.<br><br>

The next morning, the villagers found Mani's body washed up on the shore. Some felt pity, others disgust, but all agreed that it was better this way. They buried him beneath a tree, its roots wrapping around Mani's grave like a silent apology.<br>
