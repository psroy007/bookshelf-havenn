        <br>
   <span>"As Naveen's obsession with revenge intensifies, he finds himself descending deeper and deeper into the darkness. His schemes grow more complex, more devious, and more violent.
    He begins to stalk his targets, watching them from a distance. He follows Divya as she walks to her bus stop, memorizing her schedule. He watches Aakash as he plays cricket in the park, studying his movements. He even breaks into Dev's house, stealing his belongings and leaving behind cryptic messages.
    Naveen's descent into madness continues, becoming more twisted and depraved with each passing day.
    He creates a shrine in his room, decorated with photographs of his targets. He mutters curses under his breath as he stares at their smiling faces, picturing their downfall in vivid detail.
    One night, as he lies awake in his bed, Naveen hears the voice again. This time, it is louder, more insistent."</span>
    <br><br><strong>Voice:</strong> "Kill them. <br><br>
   <span>Naveen stands up, his eyes wide and bloodshot. He walks to his closet and pulls out a black duffel bag. Inside are several weapons he has collected over the past few weeks: a hammer, a screwdriver, a set of knives.
    He hefts the bag over his shoulder and walks out of his apartment, his heart pounding in his chest. The night is still and quiet, but Naveen can hear the voice in his head, urging him forward.
    *He stops at the bus stop where Divya waits every morning.
    Naveen hides behind a nearby dumpster, watching as Divya arrives at the bus stop. She glances around, oblivious to the danger that lurks nearby.
    Naveen steps out from behind the dumpster, the duffel bag in his hand. Divya sees him and smiles, thinking that Naveen has come to make amends.</span>
    <br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Naveen? What are you doing here? <br><br>
   <span>*Naveen ignores her question, his eyes fixed on the knife in his hand.
    Without a word, Naveen lunges at Divya, grabbing her by the hair and pulling her down to the ground. She screams in terror, trying to fight him off, but Naveen is too strong.
    He raises the knife high above his head, a wild gleam in his eyes. Divya sobs hysterically, begging for mercy, but Naveen doesn't hear her. He brings the knife down, plunging it into her chest.
    Divya's screams are cut short as her lifeblood spills onto the pavement, her eyes rolling back into her head.
    Naveen stands over Divya's lifeless body, the knife still in his hand. For a moment, he is frozen, stunned by the enormity of what he has just done. But then the voice speaks again.</span>
    <br><br><strong>Voice:</strong> "Now for the others. <br><br>
   <span>*Naveen wipes the blood from the knife on his shirt and takes off running, disappearing into the night. He knows that Divya is just the first.
    The next morning, Divya's body is discovered at the bus stop. The police are called, and a manhunt is launched to find her killer. Investigators comb through CCTV footage and speak to witnesses, but the trail goes cold.
    Naveen, meanwhile, has gone underground. He holes up in a cheap motel on the outskirts of the city, hiding from the authorities and planning his next move.
    As the days pass, the city is gripped by fear. The press dubs Divya's killer the "Bus Stop Butcher," and rumors swirl about who the next victim might be.
    Naveen, now driven by a thirst for revenge and a growing sense of power, turns his attention to Aakash, his next target.
    He stalks Aakash to the cricket field where he plays every Saturday, waiting in the shadows until the game is over and the players disperse.
    Aakash is alone when Naveen strikes, grabbing him from behind and putting a screwdriver to his throat.</span>
    <br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "What the... Naveen? What are you doing?" <br><br>
   <span>*Naveen ignores Aakash's pleas for mercy.
    Aakash struggles against Naveen's grip, but the screwdriver digs deeper into his neck. Naveen's grip is unrelenting, and Aakash knows that he is fighting for his life.</span><br><br>
    "Please, Naveen," <strong>Aakash</strong> begs."We can talk about this. I didn't mean to hurt you!" <br><br>
    Naveen's eyes are wild and his breathing heavy. He leans in close to Aakash's ear.
    <br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "You made me a joke. Now it's your turn." <br><br>
   <span>Without another word, Naveen drives the screwdriver into Aakash's neck, twisting it until the life leaves his eyes. He releases Aakash's body and watches it crumple to the ground.
    Naveen stands there for a moment, his heart pounding in his chest. The rush of adrenaline he feels is intoxicating. He feels powerful, unstoppable. He feels alive.
    He turns and walks away from the cricket field, leaving Aakash's body to be discovered the next morning.
    As news of Aakash's murder spreads, the city is thrown into a frenzy of fear and speculation. The police, already stretched thin by the hunt for the "Bus Stop Butcher," scramble to find any leads.
    Naveen, meanwhile, is growing bolder. He begins leaving taunting messages for the authorities at the scene of his crimes, daring them to catch him.
    He knows that Dev is his final target, but he wants to play with him first. He wants to see him suffer.
    So he sets his sights on Dev's girlfriend, Riya.
    Naveen, with his sights set on Riya, begins his game of cat-and-mouse. He follows her around town, taking note of her daily routine. He even breaks into her apartment, leaving behind a bloody screwdriver and a note.
    Riya, terrified by the intrusion, goes to Dev for comfort and protection. But Naveen's plan is already in motion.
    *One night, as Riya is leaving her office, Naveen strikes. He grabs her from behind, covering her mouth to silence her screams.
    Riya struggles in Naveen's grip, but he is too strong for her. He drags her to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city, his heart racing with excitement.
    Riya, her eyes wide with terror, tries to reason with Naveen.</span>
    <br><br><strong>Riya:</strong> "Please, Naveen. Whatever Dev and the others did to you, I had nothing to do with it. Please let me go!" <br><br>
    Naveen's lip curls into a sneer.
    <br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "You're right, Riya.
    Naveen's words send a chill down Riya's spine.
    <br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "You didn't hurt me. But you love someone who did. And that makes you just as guilty." <br><br>
    Naveen produces a hammer from his bag, a wicked grin on his face.
    <br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "You see, I've decided to make you a message for Dev. A warning of what's to come." <br><br>
   <span>Riya's screams echo off the walls of the warehouse, but there is no one there to hear them.
    With each brutal strike of the hammer, Naveen's rage grows. He relishes the power he feels as he rains down blow after blow on Riya's broken body.
    When he is finished, he stares down at her lifeless form, his breathing heavy. He feels no remorse, no guilt.
    Naveen drags Riya's body into the center of the warehouse, arranging it into a grotesque display. He wants Dev to see what he has done when he comes to find her.
    And then, he waits.
    Days pass, and still there is no sign of Dev. Naveen, impatient and restless, decides to take matters into his own hands.
    One night, he breaks into Dev's apartment, a knife hidden in his jacket.
    Dev, awoken by the noise, stumbles out of his bedroom, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.</span><br><br>
   <strong>Dev:</strong> "Who's there?" <br><br>
    Naveen steps out of the shadows, a cruel smirk on his face.
    <br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Hello, Dev..."
