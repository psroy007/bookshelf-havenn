<span style="line-height: 3.5vh;">"Naveen is a shy and introverted young man. He attends tution every evening and is often unnoticed by his peers. One day, a new student named Divya joins the class.
Divya is beautiful and popular, and Naveen is immediately smitten with her. He begins to daydream about her, and finds himself constantly thinking about her.
One day, Naveen works up the courage to write a love letter for Divya. He spends hours pouring his heart into it, describing his feelings and admiration for her.
Naveen brings the letter to tution, intending to give it to Divya. But he is too nervous to do so, and instead keeps it in his pocket.
During tution, Naveen is so preoccupied with thoughts of Divya that he doesn't realize the letter has slipped out of his pocket. When the teacher calls him to the front of the class, he is unaware of the disaster waiting to happen." <br><br> </span>
<strong>Teacher:</strong> "Naveen, it's your turn to solve the problem on the board." <br><br>
Naveen approaches the board, still unaware of the love letter on the floor.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Umm, yes sir. I'm on it."
<br><br><strong>Teacher:</strong> "Are you sure? You seem a bit distracted today."
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "No sir, I'm focused. Just give me a moment." <br><br>
The teacher waits patiently, as the rest of the class begins to notice the letter on the floor.
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "Hey Naveen, what's that on the floor?" <br><br>
The teacher turns to look, and sees the letter.
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "Hey Naveen, isn't that your handwriting?" <br><br>
Naveen, who is still focused on the board, doesn't respond.
<br><br><strong> <span style="line-height: 4vh;">Teacher:</strong> "What's this, Naveen?" <br><br>
The teacher picks up the letter and begins to read it aloud, completely oblivious to the catastrophe unfolding. <br><br>
The teacher reads the letter, which begins with a declaration of Naveen's love for Divya.</span><br><br>
<strong><span style="line-height: 4vh;">Teacher (reading):</strong> "Dear Divya, I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I just wanted to tell you how I feel. I've been admiring you for a while now, and I..." <br><br>
The class breaks out into uncontrollable laughter. Naveen's face turns beet red, and he looks down at the ground in humiliation.</span>
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Please, sir. I'm sorry. Please don't read that." <br><br>
The teacher finally realizes the situation and stops reading the letter.
<br><br><strong>Teacher:</strong> "Naveen, is this a joke? What were you thinking?"
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean for anyone to read it." <br><br>
Naveen's face burns with embarrassment. He looks around the class, which is now filled with stares and giggles.
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "Wow, Naveen. I didn't know you had such strong feelings for Divya!"<br><br>
The teacher, sensing the tension, tries to diffuse the situation.
<br><br><strong>Teacher:</strong> "Alright, enough. Naveen, please go back to your seat." <br><br>
Naveen reluctantly returns to his seat, wishing the ground would swallow him whole.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Naveen, you didn't have to do that. I mean, it was really nice, but..." <br><br>
Naveen interrupts her, not wanting to hear her rejection.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "No, Divya. I don't want to hear it." <br><br>
<span>Divya looks hurt, but she nods her head and stays silent.
The class continues, but Naveen is too upset to focus. He feels humiliated and defeated.
After tution, Naveen makes a beeline for the exit. He doesn't want to face anyone, especially not Divya.
Outside, he begins to walk home.</span><br><br>
<strong>Naveen (to himself):</strong> "I'm so stupid. I can't believe I let that happen." <br><br>
<span style="line-height: 4vh;">Naveen trudges home in silence, replaying the disastrous events of tution in his mind.
He arrives home and heads straight to his room. He flops onto his bed and buries his face in his pillow.
Naveen's phone buzzes with a message from Aakash.</span>
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "Dude, are you okay? Sorry if I embarrassed you earlier."
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "It's fine. I'm just not in the mood to talk."
Aakash continues to message Naveen, trying to cheer him up.
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "Come on, Naveen. You can't just mope around all day. Let's do something fun this weekend!"
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "I don't know, Aakash. I'm not feeling up for anything." <br><br>
<span style="line-height: 4vh;">Naveen's heart sinks as Divya ignores him for the rest of the week. He tries to tell himself that he doesn't care, but he can't shake the feeling of rejection.
At tution, the students continue to tease Naveen. He tries to ignore their comments, but they get under his skin.
One day, as he's walking home from tution, Naveen spots Divya with a group of her friends. They're laughing and talking, oblivious to Naveen's presence.
Naveen watches Divya with a mix of anger and sadness. He's hurt that she's so easily moved on from what happened, while he's still struggling to cope with it.
As Divya and her friends walk past Naveen, one of them bumps into him roughly.</span><br><br>
<strong>Divya's Friend:</strong> "Watch where you're going, loser." <br><br>
Naveen turns to glare at the friend, his fists clenched.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "You know, you're just like her. You think you're so much better than everyone else." <br><br>
The friend laughs, but Divya turns to look at Naveen.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Hey, what's that supposed to mean?"
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Nothing, Divya. It's just the truth."
Naveen turns and begins to walk away, but Divya calls after him.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Wait, Naveen! Can we talk?"
Naveen pauses for a moment, then turns back.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "What do you want to talk about?"
Divya's friends drift away, leaving her alone with Naveen.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "I wanted to apologize. I know I've been ignoring you, but I wasn't sure how to handle the whole situation."
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "So you thought ignoring me would make it better?"
Naveen's expression hardens and he looks away from Divya.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Whatever. I'm not interested in talking about it anymore." <br><br>
<span style="line-height: 4vh;">Divya stands for a moment, surprised by Naveen's change in attitude.
Naveen turns and walks away, leaving Divya alone on the street. She watches him go, a conflicted expression on her face.
As the days pass, Naveen continues to avoid Divya. He focuses on his schoolwork and his friends, determined to forget about the girl who rejected him.
Naveen tells himself that he's over Divya, but the truth is that he can't stop thinking about her. Every time he sees her in the hallways, or hears her name mentioned by a classmate, he feels a sharp pang of pain in his chest.
Despite his best efforts, Naveen finds himself drifting off in class, replaying their conversation in his head. He can't help but wonder if there was something he could have said or done differently.
*One day, after tution, Naveen spots Divya talking to Aakash.
Aakash listens attentively as Divya pours her heart out, explaining her true feelings for Naveen.</span>
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "I was afraid that if I talked to Naveen, everyone would make fun of him even more. I didn't want to hurt him, so I thought it would be better to just keep my distance."
Aakash nods, his brow furrowing.
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "I see. So you don't actually like him in that way?"
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "No, I don't. I just want him to know that I wasn't trying to be mean or anything."
Divya looks troubled, biting her lip.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "I guess I should have handled it better."
Aakash places a reassuring hand on her shoulder.
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "Don't be too hard on yourself. You didn't do anything wrong." <br><br>
<span style="line-height: 4vh;">One day Naveen messages Divya and told that he was ignoring him because he thought se was having a relationship or situationship with someone so he tried to maintain a distance
Divya receives Naveen's message while at home.</span>
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Naveen? Why are you messaging me now?"
She reads the rest of his message, her eyes widening.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "What? Who told you that? That's ridiculous!"
Naveen replies quickly, his words filled with indignation.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Aakash told me that he saw you with some guy. Is it true?"
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "No! That's a complete lie. Why would Aakash say something like that?"
Divya shakes her head, confused and angry.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "I don't know why Aakash would lie to you like that. I haven't been seeing anyone."
Naveen reads her message, his anger starting to dissolve.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Are you sure? Because I don't know what to believe anymore."
Divya types furiously, her emotions starting to take over.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Of course I'm sure! I'm not the kind of person who would do something like that. You should know that by now." <br><br>
<span style="line-height: 4vh;">Naveen, still struggling to make sense of the situation, decides to consult his best friend Dev.
Naveen finds Dev hanging out at a local café and joins him, ordering a drink.</span>
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Hey man, how are you doing? You look troubled."
Naveen takes a sip of his drink, trying to find the right words.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "I'm not doing great. I think Aakash lied to me."
Dev's eyebrows shoot up.
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Aakash? What's going on?"
Dev listens attentively as Naveen explains everything, his expression shifting from confusion to anger.
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "That's messed up. I can't believe Aakash would pull something like that. I guess he's not the friend you thought he was."
Naveen nods, but his mind is still racing.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "What should I do? I don't want to make things worse."
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Well, for starters, you should definitely tell Aakash off. And then, why not try talking to Divya again?Naveen takes Dev's advice, confronting Aakash the next day at tution.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "I know what you did, Aakash. You lied to me about Divya."
Aakash looks guilty, his eyes darting around the room.
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "I was just kidding around, man. It was a joke. I didn't think you'd take it so seriously."
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Well, I did take it seriously. And it wasn't funny."
Seeing Naveen's confrontation with Aakash, Divya rushes over to defend her friend.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Naveen, you're overreacting. Aakash was just joking. He didn't mean any harm."
Naveen is stunned by Divya's response, feeling betrayed by both Aakash and Divya.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Joking? Seriously? And you're taking his side? What about what I've been through?
Divya looks uncomfortable, unsure how to respond.
Divya tries to diffuse the situation, but her words come out a bit harsher than intended.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Look, I'm sorry if you were hurt, but you're blowing this out of proportion. It was just a joke, and you need to learn how to take one."
Naveen's face hardens, his voice cold and measured.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Fine. If that's how you feel, then I don't need either of you in my life."
Just as Naveen is about to storm out of tution, Dev steps in, his voice calm and steady.
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Naveen, Divya. Can we please talk about this rationally? There's no need for anyone to be leaving here angry."
Naveen and Divya both look at Dev, unsure how to respond.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "I'm sorry, but I'm not the one who's overreacting here."
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Maybe not, but let's try to understand each other's perspectives.
Naveen, Divya, and Dev take a seat at the tea stall, the tension still thick between them.
Naveen, Divya, and Dev continue their conversation without Aakash, the air between them slowly starting to clear.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Naveen, I'm sorry if I came off as uncaring earlier. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
Naveen looks at Divya, his anger melting away.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "It's okay, Divya. I think we all just got caught up in the drama. It wasn't fair of me to assume you were involved."
Divya nods, a small smile playing at the corners of her lips.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "I appreciate you saying that, Naveen. And I want you to know that I never meant to be cruel to you. You're a great guy, even if you are a little shy."
Naveen blushes, suddenly aware of the proximity between them.
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Hey, lovebirds. I'm still here, you know."
The tension breaks as the three friends laugh.
As the conversation continues, Divya finds herself increasingly drawn to Dev's humor and charm. She laughs heartily at his jokes, and occasionally glances at Naveen to see if he's noticing.
Divya (to Dev): "Seriously, you're too funny. You should consider doing stand-up or something."
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Well, if I can make a gorgeous girl like you laugh, I must be doing something right."
Divya blushes at the compliment, shooting a quick glance at Naveen to gauge his reaction.
Dev, sensing the attention Divya is giving him, decides to turn up the charm. He turns to Naveen with a mischievous grin.
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Hey Naveen, do you remember that time you got so nervous before your chemistry practical that you spilled hydrochloric acid all over your notebook? I guess your love life wasn't the only thing you needed to keep in check that day."
Naveen rolls his eyes, but can't help but chuckle at Dev's comment.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Very funny, Dev.
Divya, still thoroughly entertained by Dev's wit, encourages him to continue.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Ooh, that was a good one. What else can you roast him about?"
Dev (to Naveen): "Well, there was also that time you forgot to put a full stop at the end of a sentence and ended up writing a fifty-word run-on sentence. I think that might be a new record for the longest sentence in Hindi literature."
Naveen shakes his head, but can't help but smile.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Okay, okay.
With each passing day, Naveen finds himself the butt of Dev's jokes more and more often. Even Divya joins in on the teasing, frequently calling Naveen "gay" or "a scared little mouse."
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Hey, come on guys. It's not that funny anymore."
Divya and Dev share a knowing glance, but they don't let up on their teasing.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "What's the matter, Naveen? Can't take a little teasing?"
Naveen sighs, rolling his eyes in defeat.
Naveen's fake smile becomes his default expression around Divya and Dev. He tries to play along, but the constant teasing takes its toll on him.
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Ha ha, very funny. You guys are so hilarious."
His sarcastic tone is not lost on Divya, who shoots him a sly look.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Oh, so you think you're funny too, huh? Maybe you should try stand-up instead of writing love letters."
Naveen looks down, trying to hide the hurt in his eyes.
Despite Naveen's efforts to hide his true feelings, Dev notices the change in his demeanor.
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Hey, Naveen, are you okay? I'm just kidding, man. Don't take it so seriously."
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Yeah, I know. It's just...sometimes it feels like you guys are always making fun of me."
Divya's face falls, realizing the effect their teasing has had on Naveen.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Naveen, we're sorry. We didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
Naveen tries to brush off the apologies, determined to move past the teasing. But as the weeks pass, he begins to make excuses to leave tution early, avoiding the possibility of further jokes at his expense.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Hey, where's Naveen going? He's leaving early again."
Dev shrugs, his own expression tinged with concern.
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "I don't know. Maybe he's got something else he needs to do."
As Naveen begins to distance himself from his friends, Divya becomes increasingly concerned.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "Aakash, have you noticed Naveen leaving tution early a lot lately?"
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "Yeah, he's been doing that for a while now. What's going on with him?"
Divya's brow furrows as she considers her answer.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "I'm not sure. But I think we might have pushed him a bit too far with all the teasing."
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "Yeah, maybe you're right."
As Naveen continues to avoid his friends, Aakash and Dev fill the gap in their group, talking and joking around as if nothing had changed.
<br><br><strong>Dev:</strong> "Man, did you see that new Marvel movie? It was insane!"
<br><br><strong>Aakash:</strong> "Dude, I know! I can't believe they killed off that character!" <br><br>
<span style="line-height: 4vh;">The two friends dive into a lively discussion, barely noticing Naveen's absence.
Meanwhile, Naveen finds himself growing more isolated. He spends his days studying and working on his assignments, but his thoughts are often elsewhere.
Naveen's isolation takes a dark turn when he finds himself struggling to sleep. As the days go by, his thoughts become more and more troubling.
One night, as he lies awake in his bed, Naveen hears a voice whispering in his ear.</span>
<br><br><strong>Voice:</strong> "Nobody cares about you. They're all laughing at you. You're worthless."
Naveen sits up, his heart racing. He tries to dismiss the voice as a figment of his imagination, but it continues to haunt him.
<br><br><strong>Voice:</strong> "You'll never be good enough. <br><br>
<span style="line-height: 4vh;">Naveen's inner turmoil grows as the voice's taunts become more frequent and disturbing. He tries to keep it to himself, but eventually, his demeanor starts to change.
His classmates begin to notice Naveen's withdrawal from social situations, and his once-bright smile becomes a tight, forced grimace. They whisper amongst themselves, wondering what could be wrong with him.
In tution, Naveen sits alone at the back of the room, his head bent over his notes. He doesn't respond when Dev or Aakash try to talk to him.
As Naveen's behavior grows more erratic, his classmates begin to keep their distance. They whisper behind his back, wondering if he's been using drugs or is suffering from some kind of mental illness.
One day, during lunch break, <br> Naveen snaps. When another student makes a snide remark about his odd behavior, Naveen stands up abruptly, knocking over his chair.</span>
<br><br><strong>Naveen:</strong> "Shut up! All of you just shut up!" <br><br>
The room falls silent as Naveen stares at his classmates, his eyes wild.
Naveen storms out of the tution room, slamming the door behind him. His classmates exchange looks of concern, unsure of what just happened.
Divya, who had been sitting nearby, approaches the group, her brow furrowed.
<br><br><strong>Divya:</strong> "What was that all about? Is Naveen okay?" <br><br>
The students shrug, not knowing what to say. One of them speaks up. <br><br>
<strong>Student:</strong> "I don't know, Divya. He's been acting weird for weeks now." <br><br>
<span style="line-height: 4vh;">Divya bites her lip, a worried look on her face.
Naveen, still seething with rage, makes his way to the rooftop of his building. He pulls the stack of unopened letters from his pocket, remembering the words Divya had said to him weeks ago.
"You're just a joke to me, Naveen. I don't take you seriously."
With a flash of anger, Naveen pulls out a lighter and sets the letters ablaze.
As the flames lick the pages, the voice in Naveen's head grows louder.</span>
<br><br><strong>Voice:</strong> "Burn it all. <br><br>
<span style="line-height: 4vh;">As the fire consumes the letters, Naveen stares at the inferno, his eyes glassy and distant. The flames seem to dance in time with the voice in his head, urging him to let go of the pain that has been haunting him.
In a sudden, frenzied movement, Naveen hurls the burning letters over the edge of the roof. They spiral downward, a fiery meteor shower in the night sky.
Naveen stands motionless, watching the embers fade into the darkness. For the first time in weeks, his mind is quiet.
As the smoke from the burning letters dissipates, a chill passes through Naveen's body. Something inside him has shifted, something dark and dangerous.
The good-hearted, shy boy who once wrote poetry and listened to soft music is gone. In his place stands a cold, calculating figure with a new purpose: to make those who laughed at him pay.</span>
