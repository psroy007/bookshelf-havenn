            Aftab was in a frenzy, frantically checking his watch as he sprinted to the interview venue. He was already running late, but he knew that if he could just make it in time, he could salvage the situation. <br><br>

            But as he turned the corner, he was suddenly grabbed from behind. A masked figure threw a sack over his head and dragged him into a nearby alleyway. <br><br>
            
            "What's going on?" Aftab shouted, struggling to free himself. "Let me go, I'm late for my interview!" <br><br>
            
            But the masked figure was unmoved. Aftab struggled and pleaded, but the masked figure was relentless. They tied his hands and feet, ensuring that he was completely immobilized. <br><br>
            
            "Please, I beg you, let me go!" Aftab cried. "You don't understand, I have an important interview!" <br><br>
            
            But the figure only laughed, their voice muffled by the mask. "You think I don't know that? You think I'm doing this for fun? You deserve this, Aftab. You deserve everything that's coming to you." <br><br>
            
            Hours passed, and Aftab began to despair. The interview would be long over by now, and there was no way he would get the job. Finally, the masked figure untied him and threw him to the ground. <br><br>
            
            "Go," the figure said. "You're free to go. But remember, this is only the beginning." <br><br>
            
            Aftab stumbled to his feet, his legs shaky from being tied up for so long. He made his way out of the alley, a look of disbelief on his face. <br><br>
            
            Aftab returned to his dorm room, his mind racing with questions. "Who would want to do this to me?" he wondered. He thought back to his time at university, trying to remember if he had any enemies. But he couldn't think of anyone who would want to sabotage his interview. <br><br>
            
            Aftab shook his head, still puzzled. "I just don't understand. Why me?" <br><br>
            
            For days, Aftab was haunted by the incident. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being targeted, but he had no idea who was behind it. One night, he decided to go for a walk, hoping to clear his head. <br><br>
            
            But as he turned a corner, he saw a figure standing in the shadows. Aftab froze. "Who's there?" he asked, his voice shaky. <br><br>
            
            The figure stepped forward, and Aftab's heart nearly stopped. It was Vicky. Aftab was stunned, unable to speak. He couldn't believe that Vicky was standing in front of him. <br><br>
            
            "Vicky?" he finally managed to say. "What are you doing here?" <br><br>
            
            Vicky just stared at him, his eyes cold and unfriendly. "I think you know why I'm here," he said. <br><br>
            
            Aftab shook his head, trying to process what was happening. "I don't understand," he stammered. <br><br>
            
            Vicky smiled, a cruel smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Oh, I think you do." <br><br>
            
            Aftab tried to back away, but Vicky stepped forward, blocking his path. "You ruined my life," Vicky hissed. "And now it's your turn to pay." <br><br>
            
            Aftab felt a chill run down his spine. "I didn't mean to hurt you," he said, his voice trembling. "I'm sorry." <br><br>
            
            Vicky laughed, a cold, hollow laugh. "Sorry isn't good enough," he said. "You're going to regret what you did to me." <br><br>
            
            Aftab's mind was racing. He knew he had to get away from Vicky, but he was trapped. "Please, let me go," he begged. "I won't tell anyone about this, I swear." <br><br>
            
            Vicky sneered. "It's too late for that," he said. "You should have thought about the consequences before you ruined my life." <br><br>
            
            Aftab's breath caught in his throat. He knew he was in danger, but he didn't know what to do. Vicky grabbed Aftab by the arm, his grip like a vice. "Do you remember what you did to me at university?" he growled. "Do you remember how you ruined my life?" <br><br>
            
            Aftab was shaking now, his whole body trembling with fear. "Y-yes," he whispered. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean toâ€”" <br><br>
            
            Vicky cut him off with a slap across the face. "Sorry isn't good enough," he spat. "Now it's your turn to suffer." <br><br>
            
            Vicky dragged Aftab down the street, his grip never loosening. Aftab felt helpless, like a lamb being led to slaughter. They reached an abandoned warehouse, and Vicky shoved Aftab inside. The room was dark, and Aftab could feel his heart racing in his chest. <br><br>
            
            "Please, Vicky, I'll do anything," he pleaded. "Just let me go." <br><br>
            
            Vicky chuckled, a cruel, twisted chuckle. "Oh, I have something special planned for you," he said. <br><br>
            
            Vicky pulled out a roll of duct tape and bound Aftab's hands and feet. Aftab struggled against his bonds, but they were too tight. "What are you going to do to me?" he asked, his voice barely more than a whisper. <br><br>
            
            Vicky just smiled and walked over to a table in the corner of the room. Aftab couldn't see what was on it, but he could hear the sound of metal on metal. "You're going to regret ever crossing me," Vicky said. <br><br>
            
            Vicky turned back to face Aftab, holding something in his hand. Aftab couldn't see what it was, but he knew it couldn't be good. "Do you remember when I got expelled from university?" Vicky asked. "Do you remember what you said to me?" <br><br>
            
            Aftab shook his head. "I-I don't know what you mean," he stammered. <br><br>
            
            Vicky stepped forward, holding up the object in his hand. "This is what you said to me," he growled. <br><br>
            
            Aftab gasped as he saw what Vicky was holding. It was a pair of bolt cutters. Vicky's face was contorted with rage. "You told me I'd never amount to anything," he said, his voice low and dangerous. "You told me I was a failure." <br><br>
            
            Aftab's heart was beating so hard he thought it might burst. "I-I didn't mean it," he pleaded. "I was just angry." <br><br>
            
            Vicky's smile was cold and dangerous. "Well, now it's my turn to be angry." <br><br>
            
            Vicky stalked over to Aftab, the bolt cutters held tightly in his hand. Aftab tried to move away, but he was still bound by the duct tape. He knew he was helpless, but he couldn't help but struggle anyway. "Please," he begged. "Don't do this." <br><br>
            
            Vicky just laughed. "Oh, I'm going to enjoy this," he said. And then he raised the bolt cutters and brought them down with a sickening crunch. <br><br>
            
            Aftab screamed in pain as Vicky brought the bolt cutters down again and again. Blood poured from his wounds, but Vicky didn't seem to care. He just kept laughing, a mad, crazed laugh that echoed through the warehouse. <br><br>
            
            Aftab could feel himself growing weaker, his vision blurring. "Please," he whispered, his voice barely a whisper. "Please stop." <br><br>
            
            But Vicky just laughed again. "Not yet," he said. <br><br>
            
            Aftab's screams grew weaker and weaker until they were nothing more than a weak whimper. Vicky stood over him, his eyes gleaming with a twisted pleasure. "Look at you," he said. "Pathetic." <br><br>
            
            Aftab could feel himself slipping away, but he forced himself to stay conscious. "P-please," he begged. "I'm sorry." <br><br>
            
            Vicky just shrugged. "Too late," he said. And with one final crunch of the bolt cutters, Aftab's world went dark. <br><br>
            
            As Aftab hovered on the edge of consciousness, his mind replayed the events that had brought him here. He saw himself at university, laughing and joking with Vicky. He remembered how they had been the best of friends, how they had studied together and shared secrets. <br><br>
            
            And then he saw himself walking into the principal's office, his heart filled with jealousy and anger. He remembered how he had betrayed Vicky, how he had lied to the principal and gotten Vicky expelled. <br><br>
            
            As Aftab's memories played out, he remembered the incident that had ruined his friendship with Vicky. Aftab had been sitting in the university canteen, watching as Vicky and Priya laughed and joked together. He had been consumed with jealousy, angry that Vicky was getting the girl he liked. And so he had hatched a plan. <br><br>
            
            He had waited until Vicky and Priya were alone together in the library, and then he had recorded them kissing on his phone. Aftab had known that if he showed the video to the principal, Vicky would be in trouble and so he had marched into the principal's office. The principal had been outraged, and Vicky had been expelled from the university. Aftab had felt a twisted satisfaction, but he hadn't thought about the consequences of his actions. <br><br>
            
            And now, as Aftab lay dying on the floor of the warehouse, he realized the error of his ways. He had destroyed his friendship with Vicky, and he had ruined Vicky's life. And now Vicky had sought revenge, and Aftab was paying the ultimate price. <br><br>
            
            "I'm sorry," Aftab whispered, his voice barely audible. "I never should have done it." <br><br>
            
            But it was too late. As the darkness closed in around him, Aftab knew that he would never be able to make things right. <br><br>
            
            As Aftab slipped away into oblivion, Vicky stood over him, watching him die. "Goodbye, Aftab," Vicky said coldly. "You should have thought about the consequences of your actions." And then he turned and walked away, leaving Aftab's body to rot in the dark and deserted warehouse. <br><br>
            
            In the days that followed, Vicky disappeared. No one ever heard from him again, but rumors spread that he had left the city, seeking a new life far away from the university and the memories of Aftab.
